### Motivation for Development  
The application is meant to give excitement to a user's "vibe & sip" experience and pair a good drink with good music. The idea being the Bops & Hops application can complete a user's thoughts for them.

### Application Description  
Bops & Hops is an application that aligns the user's favorite musical artist to a list of cocktails and beverages.

### Functionality  
The user types in their artist and liquor of choice in the appropriate search forms. Non-alcoholic drinks are avaiable for those who do not drink alcohol.

When the "Results" button is clicked, the user is presented with an album from the artist they chose and a selection of four drinks that go with the mood. The drink that is presented with the album has an image and recipe.

![Drink Cards](/assets/screen-shots/3-Drink-Cards.png?raw=true)

The user can click on each of the drinks at the bottom of the page, and that drink will move to under the album artwork with its image and recipe. The drink it replaces will move down to one of the three cards.

 If the user does not fill in either artist or beverage search form, they receive an error message prompting them to fill in both search forms.

If the user closes the page, when they open it up again, their most recent search criteria of artist and liquor will run again and they will be presented with a new album and four drinks.
